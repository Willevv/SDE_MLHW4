Homework report and code from the course SF2525 'Computational Methods for Stochastic Differential Equations and Machine Learning' regarnig a Neural Network where the weights are calcuklated using stochastic gradient decent and a part 1 regarding standard gradient descent. In this homework I got familiar with the High-lever API Keras in TensorFlow.
